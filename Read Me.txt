This was the first game I ever made in python. 
I made it last year and it's due for some changes especially in the collision-detection section. 
I'm a frequent user of public transport, so I thought I'd model a game after an integral part of my day. 
I'll probably add music, a scoring system and scoreboard, brakes and speed and revamp the graphics later. 
Any comments or input is greatly appreciated.
